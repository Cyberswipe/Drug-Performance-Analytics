# Abstract
In recent times, the pharmaceutical industry has undergone a remarkable transformation, driven by the rapid advancement in the analytics domain. The surge in usage of advanced data analytics methodologies to drive business and healthcare related decisions has propelled the Pharma industry. This evolution has seen pharmaceutical companies increasingly embrace pharma analytics and digital technologies to enhance their operational efficiency and fortify their resilience against unforeseen disruptions, such as global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This digital surge has not only resulted in the generation of vast actionable data, but has also given rise to innovative methods of collecting, processing, and scrutinizing a diverse range of data, encompassing structured, semi-structured, and even unstructured information. For this case study, the dataset from https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/index was used. It contains a collective vault of drug related attributes and information. The original dataset mined directly from the source contained over 2000 rows worth of information. On performing an extensive EDA to clean up and wrangle the dataset, over 1000 rows of information related to drug usage and user ratings was remaining.
